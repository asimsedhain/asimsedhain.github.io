# Summer 2020

I had thought of starting to write or at least chronicle my journey into this strange summer a while ago. But its better late than never. So, here we are.

When this summer began, I had just lost an internship, my flight home was cancelled and every plan I had made for the foreseeable future was put on halt. Like everyone else, COVID-19 had changed my every arrangement. With school being online, I sat everyday in my room, looking at the news hoping for it to subside before the summer began. But well, we know what happened. Anyway, instead of doing nothing and letting my summer go to waste, I decided to do what I can. One of those things in to write. Write about everything I learned during this summer. Be it good or bad, failure or success, happy or sad. And share it with the world.

My goals for this summer is a cool story that I can share with people. Tell them this is what I did.

This is chapter one for that. Let's hope to continue on this journey.
