	👋 Hi, I'm Ashim, a software engineer who loves to tinkering around with
	code. When I'm not doing that, I'm like a curious inventor in my home lab,
	playing with gadgets and gizmos. I also enjoy staying active – you'll often
	find me working out or taking relaxing walks.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, and guess what's got me excited these days? Rust! I'm diving deep into
	its world and exploring how it can team up with C using FFI. You can find
	some of my ramblings below.
